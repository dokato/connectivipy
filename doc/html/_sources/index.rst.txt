ConnectiviPy documentation
========================================
Python connectivity module. It is a part of GSOC 2015 project. 

You can find it and download from `GitHub
<https://github.com/dokato/connectivipy>`_.

*Connectivity estimation is one of the most important problem in EEG/MEG 
studies. Many estimators work correctly in different applications, so it's
convenient to have them all in one tool. ConnectiviPy 
is light and  extendable python module open for many data formats. In
opposite to other packages it allows you to work with all types of data,
not only biomedical. Calculations base on numpy and scipy what provides
good efficiency.*

Tested under Python 3.6 and 3.8.
